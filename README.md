### Creating a new Payment Request to obtain a Session Payment URL

Just provide the information of the payment needed and you will get a process url if its successful, for this example we are using the MINIMUM INFORMATION that needs to be provided

```
String reference = 'COULD_BE_THE_PAYMENT_ORDER_ID";
String data = 
            "{  " +
            "   \"payment\":{  " +
            "      \"reference\":\"TESTING123456\"," +
            "      \"amount\":{  " +
            "         \"currency\":\"COP\"," +
            "         \"total\":\"10000\"" +
            "      }" +
            "   }," +
            "   \"ipAddress\": \"127.0.0.1\"," +
            "   \"userAgent\": \"PHPUnit\"," +
            "   \"returnUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/your.url.com\\/return?reference=TESTING123456\"" +
            "}";

RedirectRequest request = new RedirectRequest(data);
RedirectResponse response = gateway.request(request);
if (response.isSuccessful()) {
    // STORE THE response.getRequestId() and response.getProcessUrl() on your DB associated with the payment order
    // Redirect the client to the processUrl or display it on the JS extension
    String redirectTo = response.getProcessUrl();
} else {
    // There was some error so check the message and log it
    response.getStatus().getMessage()
}
```

### Obtain information about a previously created session

```
RedirectInformation response = placetopay.query("THE_REQUEST_ID_TO_QUERY");
if (response.isSuccessful()) {
    // In order to use the functions please refer to the com.placetopay.java_placetopay.Entities.Models.RedirectInformation class

    if (response.getStatus().isApproved()) {
        // The payment has been approved
    }
} else {
    // There was some error with the connection so check the message
    System.out.print(($response.getStatus().getMessage() + "\n");
}
```
